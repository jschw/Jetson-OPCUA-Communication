# NVIDIA Jetson Nano: Communication with industrial PLC via OPC UA

The Jetson Nano is a great device for small experiments with AI. But it can also being used for simple AI tasks in an industrial environment.
In this project you can find an example for sending some data from the PLC to the Jetson via OPC UA. After processing with a neural net or something else, the result is being written back to the OPC interface so the PLC can do further processing or trigger a reaction based on the result.
